# Camera2-Video
A simple Android wrapper for interfacing with the new Camera2 API for video capture.

## Usage
### Setup
For an example, check out the sample app included.

Firstly, create a `Fragment` and extend `com.wesley.camera2.fragment.Camera2Fragment`. You will be required to override the following methods:

1. `getTextureResource` - this needs to return an ID for an `com.wesley.camera2.widget.AutoFitTextureView` in your layout.
2. `getVideoFile` - this needs to return a `File` for the `MediaRecorder` to save to (ie: where the video will be saved to).

### Start and Stop Recording
To start recording, simply call `startRecordingVideo()` and to stop, use `stopRecordingVideo()`. Once stopped, the video is saved to disk and the `MediaRecorder` is setup again to start a new recording. To check if the app is currently recording a video or not, a method `isRecording()` is provided.

### Customisation
The new Camera2 API has greatly changed how to interface with the camera. This library doesn't provide complete customisation, but it does allow override a few setup methods:

1. `setUpCaptureRequestBuilder(CaptureRequest.Builder builder)` - the default setup only does `builder.set(CaptureRequest.CONTROL_MODE, CameraMetadata.CONTROL_MODE_AUTO);`, however, you can override `setUpCaptureRequestBuilder` and build the CaptureRequest yourself.
2. `protected void setUpMediaRecorder() throws IOException` - care needs to be taken when overriding this method. If you need to customise any `MediaRecorder` settings, overriding this method will allow that. Currently, the encoding frame rate is set to 30, and the bit rate to 1600

With Marshmallow, permissions are granted (or denied) at runtime. This library takes care of all that, including the rationale prompt (a dialog explaining why you need permission to use the feature - only shown if the user continuously denies permission). To customise the rationale message, during `onCreate()` simply call 

`setRationaleMessage(String message)`

or 

`setRationaleMessage(int messageResource)`

### Error Handling
All exceptions related to file handling and camera setup are caught. Default behaviour is to `Log` the exception. If you need to manually handle these, override one or more of the following:
 - `void onCameraException(CameraAccessException cae);`
 - `void onNullPointerException(NullPointerException npe);`
 - `void onInterruptedException(InterruptedException ie);`
 - `void onIOException(IOException ioe);`
 - `void onConfigurationFailed();`
